It offers blazing fast performance utilizing multicore processing, and requires zero configuration.

## Getting Started

Before we get started, you'll need to install Node for your project if you haven't already.

```sh
npm install -g parcel-bundler
```

Then with npm you can install dependencies from package.json

```sh
npm install
```

Now you can just run it with:

```sh
parcel index.html
```

You should get a URL that looks something like: `http://localhost:1234/`.
